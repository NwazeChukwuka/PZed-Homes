# Permission & UI Updates Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Removed Owner/Manager Restrictions**
- **File**: `lib/core/navigation/app_router.dart`
- **Change**: Removed redirect restriction on `/booking/create` route
- **Impact**: Owner and Manager can now access ALL pages without restrictions
- **Behavior**: They can view everything; UI elements are hidden based on assumed role

### 2. **Hide UI Elements Instead of Showing Warnings**
- **File**: `lib/presentation/screens/user_profile_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `initState` navigation blocking for non-management viewing other staff
  - Removed orange warning banner about "Limited view"
  - Added comment: "Owner/Manager have full access to all profiles. Non-management staff should not reach this screen for other users (hidden in UI)"
- **Impact**: Non-management staff won't see navigation options to view other staff profiles (hidden in HR screen), so they never reach the warning state

### 3. **Added Payment Method to Receptionist Booking Form**
- **File**: `lib/presentation/screens/create_booking_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `_paymentMethod` state variable (default: 'Cash')
  - Added dropdown with options: **Cash**, **Transfer**, **POS**, **Credit**
  - Payment method is saved with booking data
- **UI**: New dropdown appears after phone number field with payment icon

### 4. **Added Booking Navigation for Receptionist**
- **File**: `lib/presentation/screens/main_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added "Create Booking" navigation item for receptionist, owner, and manager roles
  - Icon: `Icons.book_online`
  - Route: `/booking/create`
  - Appears in sidebar/drawer navigation after Dashboard

### 5. **Hide "Assume Role" Button from Non-Management**
- **File**: `lib/presentation/screens/main_screen.dart` (line 387-437)
- **Existing Code**: Already checks `isOwnerOrManager` before showing the "Assume Role" button
- **Status**: ✅ Already implemented correctly
- **Behavior**: Only Owner/Manager see the "Assume Role" button in desktop app bar

## Role-Based Access Summary

### Owner & Manager
- ✅ Can access ALL pages
- ✅ Can view all staff profiles
- ✅ Can assume other roles to test workflows
- ✅ Can create bookings with payment methods
- ✅ See "Assume Role" button in app bar

### Receptionist
- ✅ Can access: Dashboard, Communications, Housekeeping, Mini Mart, Bookings, Profile
- ✅ Can create bookings with payment method selection (Cash/Transfer/POS/Credit)
- ✅ Cannot view other staff profiles (navigation hidden)
- ❌ Cannot see "Assume Role" button

### Other Staff (Bartender, Housekeeper, Kitchen, etc.)
- ✅ Can access their role-specific pages
- ✅ Can view their own profile only
- ❌ Cannot view other staff profiles (navigation hidden in HR screen)
- ❌ Cannot see "Assume Role" button
- ❌ No warnings shown - UI elements are simply hidden

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login as Owner → Verify access to all pages
- [ ] Login as Manager → Verify access to all pages
- [ ] Login as Receptionist → Verify "Create Booking" appears in navigation
- [ ] Create booking as Receptionist → Verify payment method dropdown (Cash/Transfer/POS/Credit)
- [ ] Login as Bartender → Verify no "Assume Role" button
- [ ] Login as Bartender → Verify cannot navigate to other staff profiles from HR screen
- [ ] Owner assumes Receptionist role → Verify UI changes to receptionist view
- [ ] Owner returns to original role → Verify full access restored

## Key Design Principles

1. **No Restrictions for Management**: Owner/Manager have unrestricted access to all features
2. **UI Hiding Over Warnings**: Non-management staff don't see options they can't use (cleaner UX)
3. **Role Assumption**: Owner/Manager can assume roles to experience staff workflows
4. **Payment Flexibility**: Receptionist can record various payment methods for bookings
