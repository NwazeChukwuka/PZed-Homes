## üéØ Key Improvements

### **Role Assumption System**
- ‚úÖ **Additive, not restrictive**: Owner/Manager keep all access when assuming roles
- ‚úÖ **Context-aware buttons**: Each screen shows the appropriate role to assume
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic UI**: Tabs and features appear/disappear based on assumed role
- ‚úÖ **Consistent color scheme**: Gold/yellow buttons match the app theme

### **Screen-Specific Behavior**

| Screen | Without Role Assumption | With Role Assumption |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Inventory** | View only (2 tabs) | Full access + Make Sale tab (3 tabs) |
| **Housekeeping** | View rooms | Full receptionist functionality |
| **Kitchen** | View recent dispatches only | Full dispatch functionality |
| **Purchasing** | View budget & history (2 tabs) | Record purchases (3 tabs) |
| **Storekeeping** | Read-only store view | Full storekeeper functionality |

### **Error Fixes**
- ‚úÖ No more cashflow negative height constraint
- ‚úÖ No more tab controller initialization errors
- ‚úÖ No more null type errors in minimart
- ‚úÖ No more button overflow in housekeeping

## üìã Implementation Details

### **Context-Aware Role Button Widget**
**Location**: `lib/presentation/widgets/context_aware_role_button.dart`

```dart
const ContextAwareRoleButton(suggestedRole: AppRole.bartender)
```

**Features**:
- Only visible to Owner/Manager
- Shows "Assume [Role] Role" or "Return to [Original Role]"
- Gold/yellow color (`Colors.amber[700]`)
- Orange color when returning (`Colors.orange[700]`)
- Automatic role detection based on context

### **Consumer Pattern for Reactive Updates**
All screens now use `Consumer<MockAuthService>` to rebuild when role changes:

```dart
return Consumer<MockAuthService>(
  builder: (context, authService, child) {
    final isAssumedRole = authService.isRoleAssumed && 
                         authService.assumedRole == AppRole.bartender;
    // Build UI based on role
  },
);
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [x] Owner can assume bartender role and see Make Sale tab
- [x] Owner can assume receptionist role in housekeeping
- [x] Owner can assume kitchen staff role and dispatch items
- [x] Owner can assume purchaser role and record purchases
- [x] Owner can assume storekeeper role for full functionality
- [x] Owner sees read-only view in storekeeping without role
- [x] Owner sees only dispatches in kitchen without role
- [x] Owner can still access all pages when assuming a role
- [x] Role buttons are gold/yellow color
- [x] No cashflow constraint errors
- [x] No tab controller errors
- [x] No null errors in minimart

## üé® Color Scheme Consistency

All role assumption buttons now use:
- **Assume Role**: `Colors.amber[700]` (Gold/Yellow)
- **Return to Original**: `Colors.orange[700]` (Orange)
- **Foreground**: `Colors.white` (White text)

This matches the app's color scheme: Green, Gold, White, Grey, Black

---

## üìù Notes

1. **Role assumption is additive**: Owner/Manager never lose access to other parts of the app when assuming a role
2. **Context-aware**: Each screen automatically shows the correct role button
3. **Reactive**: UI updates immediately when role is assumed or returned
4. **User-friendly**: Info cards explain what's available and how to get full access
5. **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality preserved

---

## üöÄ Ready for Testing

All requested fixes have been implemented and tested. The app now has:
- Consistent role assumption across all screens
- Proper error handling and null safety
- Responsive UI that adapts to role changes
- Clear visual feedback for role assumption status
- Read-only views where appropriate for Owner/Manager

The role assumption system is now fully functional and user-friendly!
